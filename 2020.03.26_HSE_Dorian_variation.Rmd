## East Sutherland Gaelic

This book is about **East Sutherland fisherfolk Gaelic**, a cluster of dialects that came into being in the early years of the XIX century. Now this dialect is present in fishing villages on the eastern coast of [Sutherland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sutherland), especially in Brora, Golspie, and Embo.
